                    Tokenizing a physical asset can streamline sales processes and remove intermediaries.
                    NFTs representing digital or physical artwork on a blockchain can eliminate the need for agents
                    and allow sellers to connect directly with their target audiences (assuming the artists know how to host their NFTs securely).
