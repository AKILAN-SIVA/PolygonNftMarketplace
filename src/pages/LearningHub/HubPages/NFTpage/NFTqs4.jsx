                    ownership or authenticity of specific digital or physical items, such as art, collectibles, and virtual goods.
                    They enable creators to sell directly to buyers, cutting out middlemen, and provide collectors with provable ownership.
                    NFTs' value is driven by an item's rarity, demand, and the blockchain's transparency. They've gained traction in art, gaming,
                    and entertainment. */}
