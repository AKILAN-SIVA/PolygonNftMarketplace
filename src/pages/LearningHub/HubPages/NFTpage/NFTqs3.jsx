                    NFTs work by leveraging blockchain technology to create unique, verifiable digital ownership.
                    Each NFT contains a distinct code that distinguishes it from others, making it non-fungible.
                    When a creator mints an NFT, the blockchain records the creation and establishes its ownership.
                    Smart contracts govern transactions, ensuring transparent, secure transfers.
                    These NFTs can represent various digital or physical assets, such as art, music, or virtual items.
                    They are bought, sold, and traded on NFT marketplaces, with transactions publicly recorded on the blockchain.
                    This immutable ledger preserves ownership history, proving the authenticity and rarity of the item, granting value to
                    NFTs in today's digital economy.
